      "I am someone who finds it very hard to describe how I am feeling. I always thought therapy wont work for me because of this reason. My Sama Health therapist made me draw with my left hand, to help me connect with my emotions and express what I was feeling. Over time, I have been able to get in touch with my emotions, which has helped me keep my anxiety in check.",
